However, if Pacman \"eats\" the blue pellet (in cell `24`), it gains the ability to \"eat\" the ghost. In this case, if Pacman lies in the same cell as the ghost, it \"eats\" the ghost and wins the game. Assume that Pacman can never be in cell `24` without \"eating\" the pellet.\n",

    "As can be seen, the performance of the model based method corresponds to the best of the three, taking into consideration the criteria of the error in the Q function (in relation to the optimal Q function) learned along iterations. The graphic shows that it is the one which more rapidly converges to the correct MDP (and hence the optimal Q function), being expected to do so if enough samples of each state are analysed, that is, if every action is experimented many times in every state. Indeed, these model based methods try to learn a model for the MDP (estimate the cost function and transition probabilities) from the experience that the agent has while interacting with the environment. In this case, the optimal Q function is learned by applying the value iteration algorithm for MDPs. This inner understanding of the system dynamics reduces the number of the samples required for learning (most sample efficient), thus its faster converge to the optimal Q-function regarding the number of iterations taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the Q-learning and SARSA algorithms allow to select actions without a model of the MDP. Although, the lesser the information about the model, the more trial and error is needed to compute the optimal Q-function, that is, more samples need to be acquired, thus more iterations are needed for converge to the optimal Q-function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing Q-learning and SARSA, for ITERS = 1000 their performance is pratically the same. Altought, when setting ITERS = 10000, it is clearly seen that the SARSA diverges from the optimal Q-function, and the Q-learning converges to the optimal Q-function. This is due to the fact that the SARSA algorithm implemented doesn't  perform policy improvement (for example, 𝜀-greedy with decaying 𝜀), in order to make sure that the policy that the agent is following slowly approaches a greedy policy. In fact, off-policy methods (being Q-learning an example) learn the value of one policy (optimal policy) while following another, being guaranteed the converge to the optimal Q-function if enought exploration is undertaken (tunable by the 𝜀 parameter). As for on-policy methods (being SARSA an example), they learn the value of the policy that it follows, computing the Q-values for its current policy, being not guaranteed that it will converge to the optimal Q. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, as more knowledge is available, suboptimal actions become less interesting, approaching the optimal Q-function, which was observed in the performances of the three algorithms. "
